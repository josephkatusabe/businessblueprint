                <figcaption>As an entrepreneur with a foundation in Entrepreneurship since high school at the African Leadership Academy, 
                    I've successfully launched and scaled three ventures. 
                    Notably, my soap making business in Uganda currently generates over USD 1000 in annual revenue and is poised for expansion through strategic mergers and acquisitions. 
                    Additionally, my laundry mart business, projected to reach USD 1000 in monthly revenue, 
                    demonstrates potential for rapid growth with its strategic location changes and increasing client base.".</figcaption>

                <h2>Kenyan internet service provider, Mawingu, raises US$9m to expand operations across Kenya.</h2>

                <p>Mawingu, a Kenyan Internet service provider operating in 15 counties, secured Series B investment with new investor InfraCo Africa, part of PIDG, committing US$6 million. 
                    This funding will aid in expanding internet infrastructure across Kenya, enhancing access for underserved households and businesses. Additionally, existing investors E3 Capital and FMO contributed US$1.5 million each. 
                    Mawingu's CEO, Farouk Ramji, emphasized their mission to provide affordable internet, aiming to connect frontier regions for societal advancement. Currently serving 7,500 customers across 15 counties, Mawingu plans to expand into 25 more counties, targeting rural markets. 
                    Notably, Microsoft's Brad Smith acknowledged Mawingu's efforts in Bloomberg, aligning with Microsoft's goal of providing internet to 100 million Africans. InfraCo Africa expressed confidence in Mawingu's potential, considering the vast addressable market of 12 million homes. 
                    The expansion, set to commence in February 2023, prioritizes western Kenya, with Stadia Capital and Bowmans Kenya facilitating the funding process. Mawingu's ambition reflects its commitment to bridging the digital divide and fostering economic development in Kenya.</p>

                <h2>HOW KENYA’S “UBER FOR AMBULANCES” IS TAKING A STANCE AGAINST COVID-19</h2>

                <p>The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global healthcare systems and highlights the importance of innovation in addressing healthcare challenges. It specifically focuses on Caitlin Dolkart, a Legatum Fellow, and her efforts to build a functional 9-1-1 system in Kenya through her startup, Rescue.co. 
                    Dolkart recognized the lack of an effective emergency response system in Kenya and aimed to bridge this gap by centralizing ambulance services and reducing response times. Despite facing challenges in convincing investors and changing perceptions, Rescue.co has become the largest ambulance network in Kenya, providing faster and more reliable emergency services.
                    With the onset of COVID-19, Rescue.co adapted its operations to support the pandemic response, ensuring that paramedics have proper protective equipment and launching initiatives like "Wheels for Life" to provide free transportation for pregnant women during curfew hours. Dolkart views the pandemic as an opportunity for innovation and emphasizes the potential for impact in emerging markets like Kenya. 
                    The article underscores the need for entrepreneurial solutions to address healthcare disparities and system deficiencies, especially in the wake of global crises like COVID-19.</p>

                    <h2>Trends in Research and Development for CO2 Capture and Sequestration</h2>
                    <p>Author: Yu X, Catanescu CO, Bird RE, Satagopan S, Baum ZJ, Lotti Diaz LM, Zhou QA | Date: 2023 Mar 23</p>

                    <p>Technological and medical advances over the past few decades epitomize human capabilities. However, the increased life expectancies and concomitant land-use changes have significantly contributed to the release of ∼830 gigatons of CO2 into the atmosphere over the last three decades, 
                        an amount comparable to the prior two and a half centuries of CO2 emissions. The United Nations has adopted a pledge to achieve “net zero”, i.e., 
                        yearly removing as much CO2 from the atmosphere as the amount emitted due to human activities, by the year 2050. 
                        Attaining this goal will require a concerted effort by scientists, policy makers, and industries all around the globe. The development of novel materials on industrial scales to selectively remove CO2 from mixtures of gases makes it possible to mitigate CO2 emissions using a multipronged approach. 
                        Broadly, the CO2 present in the atmosphere can be captured using materials and processes for biological, chemical, and geological technologies that can sequester CO2 while also reducing our dependence on fossil-fuel reserves. In this review, we used the curated literature available in the CAS Content Collection to present a systematic analysis of the various approaches taken by scientists and industrialists to restore carbon balance in the environment. 
                        Our analysis highlights the latest trends alongside the associated challenges.</p>
